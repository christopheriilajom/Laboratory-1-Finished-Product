                    <td>Standing with feet shoulder-width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this action, 
                        they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides.
                         Squats train the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, gluteal muscles, and core. 
                         The height of the squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the individual i.e.
                         if someone struggles with exercise they can do half or quarter squats. They are among the most versatile calisthenic exercises because they can be performed easily in most environments and with a limited amount of space..</td>
