        <h2>History</h2>
        <h4><em>When Calisthenics start?</em></h4>
        <p>The word calisthenics comes from the ancient Greek words kalós (καλός), which means "beautiful" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure that derives from the perfection of the human body), and sthenos (σθένος), meaning "strength" (great mental strength, courage, strength, and determination). It is the art of using one's body weight as resistance in order to develop physique. The practice was recorded in use in Ancient Greece, 
            including the armies of Alexander the Great and the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae.
            Calisthenics is associated with the rapidly growing international sport called street workout.
            The street workout consists of athletes performing calisthenics routines in timed sessions in front of a panel of judges. 
            The World Street Workout & Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF) based in Riga, Latvia orchestrates the annual National Championships and hosts the World Championships for all the national champions to compete at one competition.
            The World Calisthenics Organization (WCO) based in Los Angeles, CA. promotes a series of competitions known globally as the Battle of the Bars. The WCO created the first-ever set of rules for formal competitions, including weight classes, timed round system, original judging criteria and a 10-point must system - giving an increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these global competitions.
