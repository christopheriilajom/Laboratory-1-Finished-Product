                            The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position while avoiding resting on the floor. Chest, shoulders, and triceps are trained with this exercise.
                             An easier version of this exercise consists of placing the hands on a wall and then bending and straightening the arms.</td>
